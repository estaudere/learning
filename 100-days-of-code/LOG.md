# #100DaysOfCode

**Start:** 12/29/20

**End:** TBD

I'm hoping to start with 30 Days of Javascript while saving some time to work on a backlog of other projects, as well as D3, data storytelling, and machine learning with FreeCodeCamp, Coursera, various books, and Python.

## Notes

### Day 1

**Focus:** JavaScript 30's JS Drum Kit

**Enthusiasm:** ü§ì

Head-first dive into JavaScript interacting with HTML. Glad that I have a good background in js/coding! This would not be ideal as a first project but I'm excited to do more.

**Goals for the future:**

* Bigger JS projects (like useful webapps!)
* More interactivity to existing webpages and web design
* Add a stylized learning page to [my portfolio](estaudere.github.com)

### Day 2

**Focus:** Enrico Bertolli's [InfoViz Coursera Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/information-visualization-fundamentals/home/welcome)

**Enthusiasm:** üòî

Love the course, super what I needed right now, but I wish I got to *code* today. Hopefully I will get to do some later today on my portfolio, perhaps, but I have so many college apps I'm procrastinating on. Earlier today I made a thing in rawgraphs.io:

![graph of top senate campaign spending](/docs/top_senate_campaigns.png)

**Goals for the future:**

* TikTok visual essay (submit to pudding.cool)
* Continue the Senate race analysis (try applying it to the GA races after results come out)

### Day 3

**Focus:** JavaScript 30's JS/CSS Clock Face

**Enthusiasm:** üòê

Need to finish my COLLEGE SUPPLEMENTS AHHH. Hopefully I will not code until they are finished today. I went over the hour on this particular project, made some edits from what he gave! Can use some more improvements but this is a working baseline. Want to do more info vis once I have the JS portion down!

### Day 4

**Focus:** JavaScript 30's JS/CSS Variables

**Enthusiasm:** ü§ì

Finally understood some concepts that would help me with inputs. I need to really practice and start memorizing this info, I want to put more of my own twists to the projects and want to be more creative since I had a lot of extra time today. Happy New Year's!

**Goals for the future:**

* More creative spin-offs of the JS exercises
* Watching the video once, then trying to solve it on my own from what I learned, or solving portions of it on my own before he finishes
* A simple JS game for my baby sister (maybe based on pixels/tapping on buttons)

### Day 5

**Focus:** JavaScript 30's Array Cardio 1 + Flex Panel Gallery

**Enthusiasm:** üòî

Agh JS reduce is super confusing and the syntax/processes are so different from Python because it's so much less abstracted. This was useful to know though and I'm glad I got to do this! I need more practice with JS arrays/methods since it will be really useful for D3.

Update: I went back later that day and did another day of JavaScript30! This one seems much more applicable to web dev, so its interesting I get to do it now. Very fun very fun and surprisingly really easy (note to self: check out what the flexbox when you get the chance to study it)!

Should I start including normal coding with #100DaysOfCode? I don't think so just because I'm trying to keep it just to coding practice, but I'm learning R in another project and it might be useful with machine learning.

### Day 6

**Focus:** A notes/wiki system

**Enthusiasm:** üò´

Not much *coding* today but I started a [wiki](https://estaudere.github.io/notes) inspired by others like Andy Matuschak's. It's part knowledgebase, part deep thinking partner. I'm hoping to house everything I've ever learned/realized in that wiki at some point. It seems like a daunting task, but I am anxious to see what it looks like when I hit 20 notes, 50 notes, 100 notes. Very motivating. I wish I could write in it all day.

### Day 7

**Focus:** City filter

**Enthusiasm:** üòê

Sort of struggling? I understand the concepts because this is all things I've seen before but this is fast‚ÄîI've never done RegEx before, or very much interacting with the web browser through code. Exciting to make something so cool, though!

### Day 8

**Focus:** Array Cardio 2

**Enthusiasm:** üòî

More array methods today, once again useful for dealing with data. Short & sweet!

### Day 9

**Focus:** Fun with HTML5 + some exploratory machine learning

**Enthusiasm:** üòê

HTML5 canvas! Took a while but I made some edits to it, now it also shows a random joke from JokeAPI. Update: finished some [exploratory analysis](../data/exploratory-analysis) on a the third Harry Potter script using NLP. I'll be integrating this with a larger project later :)

### Day 10

**Focus:** Machine Learning Basics (Kaggle)

**Enthusiasm:** üòå

Completed a Kaggle course on decision trees and random forest trees! I hope to be able to apply these concepts conceptually as well, instead of just rote application. Would help to generate some sort of starter code in my wiki for this! Useful to know the basics when I felt previously that I jumped ahead.

**Goals for the future:**

* Machine learning wiki page(s)
* Using different datasets
* More Kaggle courses! They are pretty helpful when you have a good basic understanding

### Day 11

**Focus:** Machine Learning Basics

**Enthusiasm:** üòê

Practiced with a random forest regressor in Python on Spotify song data to predict song popularity. Data was from Kaggle, code can be found [here](../data/spotify-data-randomforest.ipynb).

### Day 12

**Focus:** Console DevTools

**Enthusiasm:** üòê

Learned a bunch of javascript console devtools with JavaScript30. Hopefully can work on a little bit of data later tonight!

### Day 13

**Focus:** notes wiki + other projects

**Enthusiasm:** üò´

Worked on my digital notes website (https://estaudere.netlify.app) and a some from other data projects (criminal race analysis mainly). I did not learn a whole lot except for some new methods to explore a dataset. Excited to work on more NLP and data research later.

### Day 14

**Focus:** data viz + other projects

**Enthusiasm:** üòå

Read through some pages from Nathan Yau's *Data Points* which is super interesting and engaging. I also worked primarily on another data analysis project in Python for another thing I'm working on. Feeling like there are just so many things to learn! I need to way to map out where the gaps in my knowledge are. (Take a look at knowledge trees!)

### Day 15

**Focus:** Javascript30

**Enthusiasm:** üò´

Desperately confused by that last lesson. I should go back and take notes on many of the concepts from this course, although this course is not structured for that kind of work. (Go back through Javascript on Codecademy?)

### Day 16

**Focus:** Data Viz

**Enthusiasm:** üòê

Finished (more or less) *Data Points* by Nathan Yau. It was fairly good as an overview of a lot of different exploratory techniques, and I was able to (sort of) apply it to a side project I am doing for data journalism/storytelling. I am hoping to apply more of it in the future.

### Day 17

**Focus:** Data Viz

**Enthusiasm:** üòê

I have not been getting as much time lately to work on computer science, and I want to go back to straight coding concepts over broad, general topics which are less engaging. Started (again) Scott Murray's D3 book and also did some deep dive explorations in the data for a side project I am work on (in Tableau for now).

### Day 18

**Focus:** Interactive Data Viz For The Web (Scott Murray)

**Enthusiasm:** ü•∞

Very happy with my progress, I wish I had time to do more! I'm super looking forward to what else D3 can do, and Scott Murray is amazing. I did way more than an hour today, and I already have some really good ideas of where I want to go with my projects.
