# #100DaysOfCode

**Start:** 12/29/20

**End:** TBD

I'm hoping to start with 30 Days of Javascript while saving some time to work on a backlog of other projects, as well as D3 and machine learning with FreeCodeCamp and Python.

## Notes

### Day 1

**Focus:** JavaScript 30's JS Drum Kit

**Enthusiasm:** ðŸ¤“

Head-first dive into JavaScript interacting with HTML. Glad that I have a good background in js/coding! This would not be ideal as a first project but I'm excited to do more.

**Goals for the future:**

* Bigger JS projects (like useful webapps!)
* More interactivity to existing webpages and web design
* Add a stylized learning page to [my portfolio](estaudere.github.com)

### Day 2

**Focus:** Enrico Bertolli's [InfoViz Coursera Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/information-visualization-fundamentals/home/welcome)

**Enthusiasm:** ðŸ˜”

Love the course, super what I needed right now, but I wish I got to *code* today. Hopefully I will get to do some later today on my portfolio, perhaps, but I have so many college apps I'm procrastinating on. Earlier today I made a thing in rawgraphs.io:

**Goals for the future:**

* TikTok visual essay (submit to pudding.cool)
* Continue the Senate race analysis (try applying it to the GA races after results come out)
