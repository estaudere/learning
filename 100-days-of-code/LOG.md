# #100DaysOfCode

**Start:** 12/29/20

**End:** TBD

I'm hoping to start with 30 Days of Javascript while saving some time to work on a backlog of other projects, as well as D3 and machine learning with FreeCodeCamp and Python.

## Notes

### Day 1

**Focus:** JavaScript 30's JS Drum Kit

**Enthusiasm:** ü§ì

Head-first dive into JavaScript interacting with HTML. Glad that I have a good background in js/coding! This would not be ideal as a first project but I'm excited to do more.

**Goals for the future:**

* Bigger JS projects (like useful webapps!)
* More interactivity to existing webpages and web design
* Add a stylized learning page to [my portfolio](estaudere.github.com)

### Day 2

**Focus:** Enrico Bertolli's [InfoViz Coursera Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/information-visualization-fundamentals/home/welcome)

**Enthusiasm:** üòî

Love the course, super what I needed right now, but I wish I got to *code* today. Hopefully I will get to do some later today on my portfolio, perhaps, but I have so many college apps I'm procrastinating on. Earlier today I made a thing in rawgraphs.io:

![graph of top senate campaign spending](/docs/top_senate_campaigns.png)

**Goals for the future:**

* TikTok visual essay (submit to pudding.cool)
* Continue the Senate race analysis (try applying it to the GA races after results come out)

### Day 3

**Focus:** JavaScript 30's JS/CSS Clock Face

**Enthusiasm:** üòê

Need to finish my COLLEGE SUPPLEMENTS AHHH. Hopefully I will not code until they are finished today. I went over the hour on this particular project, made some edits from what he gave! Can use some more improvements but this is a working baseline. Want to do more info vis once I have the JS portion down!

### Day 4

**Focus:** JavaScript 30's JS/CSS Variables

**Enthusiasm:** ü§ì

Finally understood some concepts that would help me with inputs. I need to really practice and start memorizing this info, I want to put more of my own twists to the projects and want to be more creative since I had a lot of extra time today. Happy New Year's!

**Goals for the future:**

* More creative spin-offs of the JS exercises
* Watching the video once, then trying to solve it on my own from what I learned, or solving portions of it on my own before he finishes
* A simple JS game for my baby sister (maybe based on pixels/tapping on buttons)

### Day 5

**Focus:** JavaScript 30's Array Cardio 1 + Flex Panel Gallery

**Enthusiasm:** üòî

Agh JS reduce is super confusing and the syntax/processes are so different from Python because it's so much less abstracted. This was useful to know though and I'm glad I got to do this! I need more practice with JS arrays/methods since it will be really useful for D3.

Update: I went back later that day and did another day of JavaScript30! This one seems much more applicable to web dev, so its interesting I get to do it now. Very fun very fun and surprisingly really easy (note to self: check out what the flexbox when you get the chance to study it)!

Should I start including normal coding with #100DaysOfCode? I don't think so just because I'm trying to keep it just to coding practice, but I'm learning R in another project and it might be useful with machine learning.

### Day 6

**Focus:** A notes/wiki system

**Enthusiasm:** üò´

Not much *coding* today but I started a [wiki](https://estaudere.github.io/notes) inspired by others like Andy Matuschak's. It's part knowledgebase, part deep thinking partner. I'm hoping to house everything I've ever learned/realized in that wiki at some point. It seems like a daunting task, but I am anxious to see what it looks like when I hit 20 notes, 50 notes, 100 notes. Very motivating. I wish I could write in it all day.

### Day 7

**Focus:** City filter

**Enthusiasm:** üòê

Sort of struggling? I understand the concepts because this is all things I've seen before but this is fast‚ÄîI've never done RegEx before, or very much interacting with the web browser through code. Exciting to make something so cool, though!

### Day 8

**Focus:** Array Cardio 2

**Enthusiasm:** üòî

More array methods today, once again useful for dealing with data. Short & sweet!

### Day 9

**Focus:** Fun with HTML5

**Enthusiasm:** üòê

HTML5 canvas! Took a while but I made some edits to it, now it also shows a random joke from JokeAPI.
