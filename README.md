# Learning

Here is where I hope to keep all my self-taught coursework and online material I find in my journey through machine learning, data, and visualization (primarily). It falls into four categories of languages:

- JavaScript
- HTML/CSS
- Python
- R (sometimes)

Right now, I am learning D3

currently learning: web dev, R, Python
