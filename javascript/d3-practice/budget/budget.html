                While owners of properties within Coppell ISD will pay the full property tax, the tax that
                the district imposes on homeowners is actually split into two parts: the maintenance and operations
                tax and the debt service tax. Maintenance and operations makes up the vast majority of the tax
                pennies, and this is the value that the state has strict rules around. The money from M&O goes
                directly to funding daily services and educational programs, like payroll and salary, general education
                departments, career and technical education, among other things. Meanwhile, the debt service tax 
                is only used to pay off interest and pricipal on bonds, which are, in turn, only used to finance 
                capital projects like building renovations or the construction of new schools. When residents vote 
                to approve a bond, they are also agreeing to take on a potential increase in debt service tax.
                The state only regulates what bonds may be used forâ€”not how much the debt service tax is. This number
                doesn't go into calculations for recapture, either.
